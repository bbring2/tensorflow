## TensorFlow
- TensorFlow is a framework using Data Flow Grap structure, and open source software library made by Google.
- 

## Why TensorFlow?
- Representation through data flow graphs.
- Automatically process differential calculations if only the calculation structure and target function are defined.
- Tensorboard shows how the parameters change and how the DNN works

## Others
- Pytorch
  - Easy to learn and High productivity.
  - Able to optimise in short time.
  
- Keras
  - Provide user-friendly, modular and scalable deliver consistent and concise APIs.
  - Easy to learn and build models
  - Supports convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks.
